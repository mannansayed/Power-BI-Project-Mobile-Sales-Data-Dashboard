 Completed a Power BI Project: Mobile Sales Data Dashboard! 📊
I'm excited to share a dashboard I built in Microsoft Power BI  This dashboard visualizes sales and transaction data for mobile phones across various Indian cities.

🔍 What’s inside the dashboard?
 ✅ Total Sales, Transactions, and Units Sold
 ✅ Dynamic Filters for Month, Mobile Model, and Payment Method
 ✅ Customer Ratings Breakdown
 ✅ Payment Mode Distribution (Credit Card, UPI, Cash, etc.)
 ✅ Sales Trends by Day & Month
 ✅ Interactive Map for City-wise Sales
 ✅ Brand & Model-wise Sales Analysis
 
💡 Key Tools Used:
 ✔️ Power BI Visualizations (line, pie, bar, funnel, map)
 ✔️ DAX for Calculations
 ✔️ Data Modeling
 ✔️ Interactive Slicers
 
This hands-on project helped me gain a practical understanding of business data visualization and reporting .
